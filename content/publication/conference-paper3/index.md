abstract: This paper discusses the temperature factors leading to permafrost instability, and explains the causes of permafrost instability from the perspective of land surface temperature (LST). First, the land surface deformation of the typical permafrost area in some period is extracted by the using the dual-track differential interferometry (D-InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1A single look complex(SLC) data. Next, the annual average LST and LST range are calculated using the spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm for MYD11A2 products. Comparing the distribution of land surface deformation and LST, findings show that permafrost regions with lower average annual LST and larger annual temperature range are more unstable and more prone to surface deformation. This research can contribute to unveiling the process where LST affects the freezing and thawing of permafrost.
