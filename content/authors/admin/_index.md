      Responsibilities include:
      - Simulating echo signals from both airborne and spaceborne SAR systems. This simulation aids in subsequent comparisons with actual echo signal metrics.
      - Deinterleaving, and decompressing echo data to calculate peak and integral sidelobe ratios, and to assess the quality of echo signals.
      - Utilizing the Range-Doppler (RD) algorithm to compress echo signals in both the range and azimuth directions, enabling focused SAR imaging.
